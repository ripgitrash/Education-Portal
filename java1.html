        <p>Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is
 concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few 
implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers 
"write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms
that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically 
compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of 
computer architecture. As of 2015, Java is one of the most popular programming languages 
in use,particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million 
developers.Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems 
(which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core 
component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax 
from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.</p>
